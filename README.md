• S2 - PYTHON CODE TO ENABLE REFLECTANCE CURVES AND THICKNESS CALCULATION

○ 1. Code to find the intial peak calibration. (Set peak to 90% of total available counts ~950 if using a 10bit ADC)

○ 2. Code to calculate the Reference spectrum to be used for reflectance calculation

○ 3. Code to calculate sensor the Dark Noise (Turn-off your light source to take this measurement)

○ 4. Code to calulate the Reflectance Curves and Thickness calculation using IIM
